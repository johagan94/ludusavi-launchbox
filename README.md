# Ludusavi for LaunchBox

Cloud save backup & restore for LaunchBox, powered by [Ludusavi](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi).  
Inspired by and modeled after [ludusavi-playnite](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite).

## Credits

- **[mtkennerly](https://github.com/mtkennerly)** — creator of [Ludusavi](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi) (the save backup engine) and [ludusavi-playnite](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite) (the Playnite plugin this project is based on)
- **[Unbroken Software](https://www.launchbox-app.com/)** — creators of [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com/), the frontend this plugin integrates with
- **Community** — plugin development by LaunchBox users

## Features

- **Automatic cloud save sync** — restore saves before playing, back them up when you exit
- **No prompts (optional)** — fully automatic mode: restore on launch, backup on exit, no dialogs
- **Known save locations for 10,000+ PC games** — via Ludusavi's manifest (sourced from [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com))
- **Platform-level emulator support** — back up ALL saves for a console platform (GBA, DS, PS2, etc.) using Ludusavi custom entries
- **Right-click game menu** — manual backup/restore per game or per platform
- **Game badges** — green dot on games recognized by Ludusavi
- **Per-game tag overrides** — `[Ludusavi] Skip`, `[Ludusavi] Game: backup`, etc.
- **Cloud sync via rclone** — supports Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.

## Requirements

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| **LaunchBox** | Version 13.x or newer (uses .NET 9.0 plugin host) |
| **Windows** | Windows 10/11 64-bit |
| **Ludusavi** | v0.24.0 or newer (v0.31.0+ recommended); installed separately |
| **rclone** | Optional and installed separately — only if using cloud sync |

## Installation

GitHub automatically shows "Source code" downloads on every release. Those are for developers and are not the plugin.

For normal installation, download the installer asset named `LudusaviLaunchBox-Setup-<version>.exe` (or, if you prefer to place the file yourself, the `LudusaviLaunchBox.dll` asset).

### 1. Install Ludusavi

Download the latest Ludusavi release from [github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/releases](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/releases).

Extract `ludusavi.exe` somewhere permanent (e.g. `C:\Tools\ludusavi\`). Launch it once to generate the default config at `%APPDATA%\ludusavi\config.yaml`.

### 2. Configure Ludusavi

Copy `examples/config.yaml` to `%APPDATA%\ludusavi\config.yaml` as a starting point. Customize:

- The **backup path** — where your save backups will be stored
- **Custom game entries** — one per emulator platform you want to back up (edit the paths to match your emulator save folders)
- **Cloud sync** — set the `remote` field to your rclone remote name if using cloud storage

### 3. (Recommended) Auto-Detect Emulator Paths

Run the discovery script to scan your system and fill in emulator save paths:

```powershell
.\scripts\discover-paths.ps1 -ConfigPath "$env:APPDATA\ludusavi\config.yaml"
```

This replaces `%RETROARCH%`, `%EMUDIR%`, `%USERPROFILE%`, and `%APPDATA%` placeholders with actual detected paths. Run it without `-ConfigPath` first to preview what it finds.

### 4. Set Up Cloud Sync (Optional)

Ludusavi uses [rclone](https://rclone.org) for cloud sync. Install it first:

```powershell
# Via scoop (recommended)
scoop install rclone

# Or download from https://rclone.org/downloads/
```

Configure a remote (example for Google Drive):

```powershell
rclone config
# n) New remote
# name> gdrive
# type> drive
# Follow the prompts to authenticate in your browser
```

Then set the remote in your ludusavi config:

```yaml
cloud:
  remote: "gdrive:"        # the colon is required
  path: ludusavi-backup
  synchronize: true
```

Test it works:

```powershell
ludusavi cloud sync --api
```

### 5. Install the Plugin

**Option A — Installer (recommended).** Download `LudusaviLaunchBox-Setup-<version>.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/johagan94/ludusavi-launchbox/releases) and run it. It finds your LaunchBox folder, drops the plugin into `Plugins`, and — because the installer writes the file itself — LaunchBox loads it with no "blocked DLL" prompt. On first run, Windows SmartScreen may warn that the publisher is unknown; click **More info → Run anyway**.

**Option B — Manual DLL.** Download `LudusaviLaunchBox.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/johagan94/ludusavi-launchbox/releases), drop it into your LaunchBox `Plugins` folder, then **unblock it** (see below):

```
C:\Users\<You>\LaunchBox\Plugins\LudusaviLaunchBox.dll
```

Restart LaunchBox after installing. Do not install the release source `.zip` or `.tar.gz`; LaunchBox needs the compiled `.dll`.

#### Unblock the DLL (manual installs only)

If you install the DLL by hand and LaunchBox shows:

> The plugin "…\LudusaviLaunchBox.dll" could not be loaded because Windows is preventing access to it for security reasons.

that is Windows' **Mark of the Web** — a flag added to *every* file you download in a browser. It is not specific to this plugin and is not fixed by code signing. Clear it one of two ways, then restart LaunchBox:

- Right-click the DLL → **Properties** → tick **Unblock** → **OK**, or
- Run in PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem "$env:USERPROFILE\LaunchBox\Plugins" -Filter *.dll | Unblock-File
  ```

The installer (Option A) avoids this step entirely.

### 6. Configure the Plugin

On first run, the plugin creates `Plugins\ludusavi_settings.json`. Edit it to set:

```json
{
  "ExePath": "C:\\Tools\\ludusavi\\ludusavi.exe",
  "BackupOnGameExited": true,
  "AskBackupOnGameExited": false,
  "RestoreOnGameStarting": true,
  "OnlyBackupOnGameExitedIfPc": false,
  "BackupByPlatformForNonPc": true
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ExePath` | `ludusavi` | Full path to `ludusavi.exe` |
| `BackupOnGameExited` | `true` | Auto-backup after exiting a game |
| `AskBackupOnGameExited` | `true` | Prompt before backing up (set `false` for silent) |
| `RestoreOnGameStarting` | `false` | Auto-restore before launching a game |
| `OnlyBackupOnGameExitedIfPc` | `false` | Skip auto-backup for emulated games |
| `BackupByPlatformForNonPc` | `true` | Use platform name for non-PC games (matches Ludusavi custom entries) |
| `AddSuffixForNonPcGameNames` | `true` | Append `" (<platform>)"` to game names when resolving in Ludusavi |

### Optional Setup Helper

The release ZIP includes helper scripts for users who want a guided setup:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-tools.ps1
```

It can install/update Ludusavi and rclone from upstream, write plugin defaults, copy the example Ludusavi config, run path discovery, and copy local HLTB theme/dataset assets when those files are available.

To register monthly maintenance:

```powershell
.\scripts\register-monthly-maintenance.ps1
```

The monthly task runs `scripts\update-maintenance.ps1`, which checks the latest GitHub release asset for this plugin and refreshes Ludusavi/rclone from their upstream downloads.

## How It Works

### PC Games

When you launch a PC game from LaunchBox, the plugin looks it up in Ludusavi's manifest (10,000+ known games from PCGamingWiki). If found, Ludusavi knows exactly where the game stores its save files and backs them up.

### Emulated (Non-PC) Games

For emulator platforms, you create custom entries in Ludusavi's config — one per console. Name them to match your LaunchBox platform names (e.g. `"Nintendo Game Boy Advance"`). The plugin detects non-PC games and backs up / restores by platform name, capturing all saves for that console.

### Tags

Add tags to any game in LaunchBox to override the global behavior:

| Tag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `[Ludusavi] Skip` | Never back up or restore this game |
| `[Ludusavi] Game: backup` | Always back up, no prompt |
| `[Ludusavi] Game: no backup` | Never back up |
| `[Ludusavi] Game: backup and restore` | Always back up AND restore |
| `[Ludusavi] Platform: backup` | Always back up by platform name |
| `[Ludusavi] Platform: no backup` | Never back up by platform |
| `[Ludusavi] Backed up` | Informational — marks game as backed up |
| `[Ludusavi] Unknown save data` | Informational — marks game with unknown saves |

## Building from Source

Requires [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

```powershell
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/johagan94/ludusavi-launchbox.git
cd ludusavi-launchbox

# Build
dotnet build src/LudusaviLaunchBox.csproj -c Release

# Output: src/bin/Release/net9.0-windows/LudusaviLaunchBox.dll
```

The project references `Unbroken.LaunchBox.Plugins.dll` from your LaunchBox install. The stub in `stubs/` is a compile-time substitute — it is not shipped.

## Releasing

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers the release workflow, which builds the plugin, compiles the installer, and publishes two assets:

- `LudusaviLaunchBox-Setup-<version>.exe` — the installer (recommended for users)
- `LudusaviLaunchBox.dll` — the bare DLL, for manual installs

```powershell
git tag v1.0.3
git push origin v1.0.3
```

Build the installer locally with `scripts\build-installer.ps1` (requires [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) — `winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup`).

### Code signing (optional)

> **Signing does not fix the "blocked DLL" error.** That error is Windows' Mark of the Web, which is stamped onto files at download time and is independent of any signature. The installer solves it by writing the DLL locally; manual installs are solved by unblocking — see [Unblock the DLL](#unblock-the-dll-manual-installs-only).

What signing *does* do is remove the SmartScreen "unknown publisher" warning shown when a user runs the installer `.exe`. It is entirely optional: if the Azure Trusted Signing secrets below are present, the workflow signs the DLL and the installer; if they are absent, the workflow still produces a working, unsigned installer.

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD tenant ID |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Service principal with Trusted Signing Certificate Profile Signer role |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Azure subscription ID |
| `TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Azure Trusted Signing account name |
| `TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERT_PROFILE` | Certificate profile name |

Setup: create an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) (free tier works), follow [Microsoft's guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/trusted-signing/how-to-signing-integrations) to create a Trusted Signing account and a certificate profile (Public Trust or Private), create a service principal with the `Trusted Signing Certificate Profile Signer` role, and add the secrets above to your GitHub repo settings.
